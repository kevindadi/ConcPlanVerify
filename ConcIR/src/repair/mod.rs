//! Phase 4: structured CIR patches and the LLM-free iterative repair loop.
//!
//! The [`ContractSpec`](crate::explore::contract::ContractSpec) is the frozen,
//! symbolic contract. It is re-resolved against every candidate program, so
//! statement/scope targets are re-bound (never stale body indices). Every
//! candidate — automatic or file-provided — goes through the same permission
//! check, static validation, supportability, re-binding, re-translation, and
//! full verification.
//!
//! Old-counterexample replay is intentionally *not* an acceptance criterion.
